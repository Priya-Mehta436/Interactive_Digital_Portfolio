# Digital Portfolio: From Static Resume to Interactive Showcase üöÄ

## üåü The Challenge: Why Your Resume Needs an Upgrade

The traditional resume is a design limitation. In a field building dynamic, interactive products, relying on static paper fails to capture a developer's true capability.

**The Problem:** Developers struggle to present complex skills and project impact visually. A static document lacks the interactivity, visual proof, and engagement necessary to stand out.

**Our Solution:** The **Digital Portfolio** is a high-fidelity, fully-featured web application. It transforms a flat list of skills into an explorable, high-impact digital showcase that immediately proves development and design proficiency.
